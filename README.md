# Echoes of Light

Welcome to *Echoes of Light*, a 2D ray-tracing art piece created for [Hackclub Blot](https://blot.hackclub.com). This project explores the beauty of light and its interactions with the environment in a simple yet captivating way.

## About the Project

*Echoes of Light* simulates rays of light emanating from a central point—a circle—and tracing their paths as they encounter various obstacles such as walls and boxes. As the light rays travel, they lose brightness over time, creating a visual representation of how light dissipates in real-world scenarios. The rays also reflect off surfaces, producing intricate patterns and effects that highlight the interplay between light and shadow.

This project not only showcases the fundamentals of ray tracing but also invites viewers to appreciate the delicate balance of light in an abstract, artistic form.

## Examples

Here are some snapshots that capture the essence of *Echoes of Light*:

Each image captures a unique moment in the simulation, revealing the dynamic and evolving nature of light as it interacts with its environment.
